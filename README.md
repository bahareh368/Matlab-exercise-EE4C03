# EE4C03 STATISTICAL DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND MODELING: Exercise Session N.01

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bahareh368/Matlab-exercise-EE4C03.git/master?filepath=index.ipynb)

First Matlab exercise session notebook for EE4C03 using the free alternative [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) for scientific computing.

This shows you how to make Octave (Matlab) code to deal with:
1. Projections
2. Singular value decomposition
3. Convolution and equalization
4. Equalization: a rank-deficient case
5. Sinusoids

This notebook has been created using the [octave_template](https://github.com/Calysto/octave_kernel) repository.
